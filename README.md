# Work Experience
## Pure Watercraft, Mechanical Engineering Intern (06/20 - 10/20)
Project management: Drove R&D of corrosion prevention to reduce coating costs & improve longevity of electrical outboard motor, battery pack, & charger. 
- Conducted outboard & battery pack coating failure analysis & presented mitigation proposals to senior executive management. Reduced initial outboard coating investment by $150k+ (62.3%).
- Developed & managed a 15-week project schedule on excel, provided updates on a consistent basis to key stakeholders, & supported supply chain on issuing PO’s.  
- Managed 10+ suppliers & effectively maintained strong working relations to ensure sourcing & procurement of parts are met for testing & product development. 

Hardware development: Implemented new injection mold flow guards for battery pack to boost & sustain device cooling & internal battery component protection.
- Successfully improved prototypes through 3D printing & released drawings for injection molding.

## Tesla, Material Flow Automation Manufacturing Intern (06/19 - 09/19)
Project management: Retrofitted bin conveyance system into pallet conveyance system.
Coordinated demolition & ensured the demo was completed as scheduled by all key players.
Automation controls: Successfully developed, tested, & installed new PLC ladder logic & new communication hardware for proper conveyor & Tesla mobile robot interface. 
- Drafted routes & performed field tests for implementing new fleets of automated guided vehicle deliveries to enable production line redundancy & headcount savings. 

UI design: Designed Human Machine Interface (HMI) screens that monitored real-time flow of the Model 3 production lines at Gigafactory 3 (GF3) in Shanghai & at Gigafactory 1 in Reno NV. 
- Develop custom animations & visual displays via python to enhance operator’s ability to process, track, & analyze production data. 
- Successfully trained the Sr. Equipment Engineer at GF3 to operate the HMI’s. 

## KPFF Consulting, Special Projects Mechanical Engineering Intern (06/18 - 09/18) 
Design: Used SolidWorks & AutoCAD to create conceptual designs of ferry gates & hydraulic systems.
- Converted 2D blueprints into 3D models for Boeing & WSDOT projects.

Analysis: Utilized Solidworks FEA to identify all risks & mitigations of modifying structural members.
- Verified FEA via hand calculations for Boeing hoist shaft & Fisher Island transfer bridge girders.


# Leadership & Special Projects  
## UW Hyperloop, Director of Integration (09/16 - 06/20)
Ranked 1st in the United States & 4th in the world at SpaceX Hyperloop Competition III 
- 4 years of full-cycle prototyping: Ground System Engineer → Suspension Engineer → Propulsion Engineer → Director of Integration 

Director of Integration (08/19-06/20): Led a team of 40+ undergraduate students to design & manufacture a hyperloop pod prototype. 
- Allocated functional requirements, maintained interface control, & guided software/hardware integration for 7 cross-functional subteams. 
- Responsible for development & documentation of hardware testing, computational analysis verification, & system safety/optimization. 
- Successfully implemented new PM platform enabling leads to improve purchasing logistics & action item prioritization. 

Propulsion Integration & Nozzle Engineer (06/17-8/19): Owned the entire cold gas thruster (CGT) CAD model, pneumatic schematic, & BOM. 
- Improved all subsystems pneumatics, resulting in over $3k savings, 20%+ weight reduction, & 30%+ increase in vehicle acceleration. 
- Designed & manufactured two aluminum conical rocket nozzles. Verified FEA through Instron tensile tests & ensured a FOS of 3+. 
- Successfully performed hydrostatic pressure & static fire tests on the CGT to evaluate system safety & performance expectations.

## UW Engineers Without Borders, Mechanical & Manufacturing Lead Engineer (10/17 - 10/18) 
Design & Manufacturing: Led a team of 20+ undergraduates in creating the UW’s first solar-powered cell phone charging station.
- Presented prototype at UW’s Engineering Discovery Day & received UW athletic director’s approval on creating 6+ for the husky stadium.
- Developed & maintained project schedule, led meetings/build sessions, & managed project funds.
